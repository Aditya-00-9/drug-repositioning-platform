metformin,Metformin,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Metformin is a first-line antidiabetic agent with established efficacy in type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests potential applications in neurodegeneration, cancer prevention, and metabolic syndrome. The AMPK-mediated mechanism provides a plausible biological rationale for repurposing, though clinical validation in non-diabetic populations remains limited. Conservative assessment: strong supportive evidence for PCOS; investigational for neuroprotection and oncology.",2024-11
sildenafil,Sildenafil,"Erectile dysfunction; Pulmonary arterial hypertension","Sildenafil is a PDE5 inhibitor with dual FDA approval for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The vasodilatory mechanism has prompted investigation in heart failure, altitude sickness, and Raynaud's phenomenon. Evidence for heart failure is mixed; altitude applications show promise but remain investigational. Conservative assessment: approved uses well-established; supportive evidence for select cardiovascular applications; investigational for altitude and peripheral vascular conditions.",2024-10
rapamycin,Rapamycin (Sirolimus),Organ transplant rejection prophylaxis,"Rapamycin (sirolimus) is an mTOR inhibitor approved for transplant rejection. The pathway's central role in cell growth, metabolism, and aging has generated substantial repurposing interest. Everolimus, a rapamycin analog, is approved for multiple cancers. Rapamycin itself shows promise in tuberous sclerosis and is under investigation for aging-related conditions. Conservative assessment: strong supportive evidence for TSC; investigational for aging; established role in oncology via analogs.",2024-09
semaglutide,Semaglutide,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; Obesity; Cardiovascular risk reduction","Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist with FDA approval for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk reduction. The drug's metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects have prompted investigation in NASH, neurodegenerative diseases, and addiction. Evidence for NASH is promising but early-stage; neuroprotection remains highly investigational. Conservative assessment: well-established for approved indications; investigational for liver and neurological applications.",2024-11
lidocaine,Lidocaine,"Local anesthesia; Ventricular arrhythmias","Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker with established use in local anesthesia and ventricular arrhythmias. Systemic administration shows promise in chronic neuropathic pain and perioperative settings, though evidence is mixed and requires careful patient selection. Topical formulations are under investigation for various pain conditions. Conservative assessment: well-established for approved uses; supportive evidence for systemic pain management; investigational for novel delivery routes and indications.",2024-07
aspirin,Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid),"Pain relief; Fever reduction; Cardiovascular event prevention","Aspirin is one of the most widely used medications globally, with established roles in pain, fever, and cardiovascular prevention. Evidence supports colorectal cancer chemoprevention and preeclampsia prevention in select populations. Investigation in neurodegenerative diseases has not shown benefit and may increase bleeding risk. Conservative assessment: well-established for approved uses; supportive evidence for cancer prevention and preeclampsia; not recommended for dementia prevention.",2024-08
propranolol,Propranolol,"Hypertension; Angina; Arrhythmias; Migraine prophylaxis; Essential tremor","Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker with multiple FDA-approved indications. Off-label uses in anxiety, hemangiomas, and performance situations are well-supported. Investigation in PTSD prevention shows promise but remains early-stage. Conservative assessment: well-established for approved uses; supportive evidence for anxiety and hemangiomas; investigational for PTSD prevention.",2024-09
